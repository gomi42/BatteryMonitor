# Battery Monitor
The battery monitor displays all data of your installed battery.

The information is devided into two sections. The **System** section shows the data reported by the operation system. The **Battery** section shows the data reported directly from the battery. Some values differ, that is normal and that's why both sections are shown.

All data are updated every 10 seconds. All system batteries are shown.

The Battery Monitor supports the dark mode and is localizable (right now English and German are supported). The Battery Monitor's UI is responsive. Resize the application to your taste to rearrange the information.
